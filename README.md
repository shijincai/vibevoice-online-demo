This repository provides a centralized place for information, guides, and an **instant online demo** for the powerful **VibeVoice Text-to-Speech (TTS) model** developed by Microsoft. Our goal is to make this frontier AI voice technology accessible to everyone.

## ✨ Key Features of VibeVoice

VibeVoice isn't just another TTS model. It excels at creating human-like, expressive audio.

-   **🎤 Expressive & Natural Voice:** Produces high-quality audio with realistic intonation and emotion.
-   **👥 Multi-Speaker & Conversational Audio:** Effortlessly creates dialogue with multiple speakers from a single text prompt.
-   **🎶 Robust to Background Noise:** Can generate clean speech even from audio prompts containing background music.
-   **🌐 Cross-Lingual Synthesis:** Maintains a speaker's vocal identity even when switching languages (e.g., Mandarin to English).
-   **🔓 Open-Source & Free:** Built on Microsoft's open-source model and offered as a free online TTS tool at vibevoice.info.


## 💡 Why This Project?

The official [microsoft/VibeVoice](https://github.com/microsoft/VibeVoice) repository contains the source code and research paper. It's fantastic for developers who want to build from the ground up.

This project, and our website **vibevoice.info**, serves a different purpose:

-   **For Everyone:** A simple, web-based interface to instantly test the model's capabilities.
-   **For Developers:** A quick way to evaluate the model's output quality before diving into the code.

Think of **vibevoice.info** as the user-friendly showcase for the incredible technology in the official repository.
